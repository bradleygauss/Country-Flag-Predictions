# Country-Flag-Predictions
This is a machine learning model that uses a decision tree to predict which landmass a country is located based on the colors on it's national flag.

The data comes from the UCI Machine Learning repository. It is a showcase of my knowledge of building a machine learning algorithm using the decision tree classification model.
